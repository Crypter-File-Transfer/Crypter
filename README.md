## Projects

### Crypter.API

A RESTful API written using ASP.NET.

### Crypter.ClientServices

A class library containing various interfaces and most of their implementations for use in client applications.

The "Repository" interfaces must be implemented per-environment, since these implementations must decide where and how to store data on the client device.
These decisions and locations are device-specific.  For example, storing data in a browser is likely to be different than storing data on a mobile phone.

### Crypter.Common

A small class library containing domain models and data types that may be used in any project.

### Crypter.Contracts

A class library containing classes and enumerations to help facilitate communcation between different projects.
For example, if Crypter.Web needs to POST some data to Crypter.API, there should be a class defining what that data looks like.

### Crypter.Core

A class library containing code to interact with the PostgreSQL database.
Most of the back-end business logic should be located here.

### Crypter.CryptoLib

A class library that mostly acts as a wrapper around the BouncyCastle cryptography library.
Most of the project's code related to cryptography is located here.

### Crypter.Test

A project containing NUnit unit tests.

### Crypter.Web

A web application written using ASP.NET Blazor web-assembly.
